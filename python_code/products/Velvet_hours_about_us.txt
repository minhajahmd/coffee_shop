Welcome to Velvet Hours, your neighborhood coffee shop nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City. At Velvet Hours, coffee is more than a drink—it's a pause, a presence, a story waiting to be shared. Whether you’re flipping through a book, admiring local art, or just catching a breath, we invite you to slow down and savor the moment.

Our Story
Founded in 2015, Velvet Hours began as a cozy family-run café with one simple mission: to create a space where good coffee, thoughtful conversation, and quiet inspiration come together.

What sets us apart is our journey—from farms to cups. Inspired by travels through South America, our team built direct relationships with small-scale coffee farmers and cooperatives. These partnerships ensure that every bean we brew is ethically sourced, high-quality, and full of care.

We roast all our beans in-house to bring out their unique flavor profiles. Each cup tells a story—from the altitude of the hillside it was grown on, to the moment it warms your hands in our café.

Delivery & Locations Served
In addition to offering a cozy place to enjoy coffee in our café, we proudly deliver to Greenwich Village, SoHo, West Village, and Lower Manhattan. Whether you’re at home, in the office, or enjoying a day at Washington Square Park, we bring your favorite coffee right to your door. Just a click away, our delivery service ensures that you never miss your daily cup, no matter where you are.

Our Menu
Our menu offers something for everyone, from our signature espresso blends to refreshing cold brews, artisanal teas, and fresh-baked goods sourced from local bakeries. We also cater to a variety of dietary needs with a range of plant-based milk options and gluten-free snacks.

At Velvet Hours, we are more than just coffee. We are part of the community, and we care deeply about sustainability.
